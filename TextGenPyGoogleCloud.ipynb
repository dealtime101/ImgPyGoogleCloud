These giants were particularly well-adapted to the cold, harsh environments of the Ice Age, with thick fur coats and impressive tusks that could reach up to 15 feet in length.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Characteristics:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Size:** 9-11 feet tall at the shoulder and 12-15 feet long.\n",
            "* **Weight:** 6-8 tons.\n",
            "* **Habitat:** Steppe-tundra and grasslands of Eurasia and North America.\n",

            "* **Short ears and trunk:** Minimized heat loss through these exposed areas.\n",
            "* **Large tusks:** Used for digging, fighting, and breaking through ice and snow.\n",

However, recent research suggests that a combination of factors, including climatic shifts and human hunting, likely contributed to their demise around 10,000 years ago.\n",
