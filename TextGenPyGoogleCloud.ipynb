            "A mammoth is an extinct species of elephant that lived during the **Pleistocene epoch**, approximately 1.8 million to 10,000 years ago. These magnificent creatures roamed the earth alongside humans and other now-extinct animals like the wooly rhinoceros and the saber-toothed cat. \n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown of what we know about mammoths:\n",

            "**Types of Mammoths:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Woolly Mammoth:** This iconic species was adapted to the cold climates of the Arctic tundra, sporting a thick coat of fur, small ears, and short tails to stay warm.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Columbian Mammoth:** These giants lived in North America and were the largest land mammals of their time, standing up to 14 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 12 tons.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Steppe Mammoth:** This species thrived in the grasslands of Eurasia and Central Asia, exhibiting features similar to the woolly mammoth but with longer fur and less dense undercoats.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Pygmy Mammoth:** Found on islands like Crete and the Channel Islands, these mammoths were much smaller than their mainland counterparts, adapting to their isolated environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Adaptations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Thick Fur:** The woolly mammoth's iconic fur coat helped them survive harsh glacial conditions, providing insulation against the cold.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Small Ears and Short Tail:** Compared to modern elephants, mammoths had smaller ears and tails, minimizing heat loss through these exposed areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Tusks:** Mammoths used their impressive tusks for various purposes, including digging for food, clearing snow, and fighting with rivals.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **High-crowned Teeth:** Their teeth were specially adapted for grinding tough, fibrous plants like grasses and sedges.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Extinction:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The exact cause of the mammoth's extinction is still debated, but a combination of factors likely played a role. These include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Climate change:** The end of the last glacial period brought warmer temperatures and shifting vegetation patterns, which may have impacted mammoth populations.\n",
            "* **Human hunting:** While evidence suggests humans did hunt mammoths, the extent to which this contributed to their extinction is still debated.\n",
            "* **Disease:** Some theories suggest diseases may have played a role in the decline of mammoth populations.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Legacy:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite their extinction, mammoths continue to fascinate and intrigue us. Their remains are found in frozen environments like Siberia, offering scientists valuable insights into their biology and behavior. They also play a significant role in folklore and mythology, capturing our imagination with their size, strength, and mysterious past. \n",
